Moon Engine is an open-source prototype game engine that uses Lua 5.3 as a scripting language to create games. This is my first attempt at creating my own game engine. This project is mostly a learning experience for myself.

## Libraries
Moon Engine utilizes the following libraries currently:
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) (Open Graphics Library)
- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
- [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) (FMOD Sound System)
- [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/) (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) (OpenGL Extension Wrangler)
- [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html) (OpenGL Mathematics)
- [SOIL](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) (Simple OpenGL Image Library)
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) (Boost C++ Libraries)

## Usage
The engine is in an early and pretty much unusable state right now for 3rd-party users. Ignoring that, the most recent stable compiled build of the engine is located in the "Build" folder in the repository.

## Open Source
You are free to copy and use parts of my source code. I do not include .sln files in the repro so if you want to compile a build of the engine by yourself, you will have to figure that out on your own.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, but only on small levels.
