Moon Engine is an open-source prototype game engine that uses Lua 5.3 as its language to create games. This is my first attempt at creating my own game engine. This project is mostly a learning experience for myself.

## Libraries
Moon Engine utilizes the following libraries:
- Lua 5.3
- OpenGL
- GLUT
- SDL 2
- GLEW
- Boost

## Usage
The engine is in an early and pretty much unusable state right now for 3rd-party users. Ignoring that, the most recent stable compiled build of the engine is located in the "Build" folder in the repository.

## Open Source
You are free to copy and use parts of my source code. I do not include .sln files in the repro so if you want to compile a build of the engine you will have to figure that out on your own.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, but I may not merge them as this is more of a personal project.
